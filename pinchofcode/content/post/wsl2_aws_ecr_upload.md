# Uploading Docker Image from WSL 2 to AWS ECR ðŸš¢

In this post, we'll walk through the process of uploading a Docker image from Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 (WSL 2) to Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) on AWS. Docker has become a cornerstone technology for containerizing applications, and AWS ECR provides a managed container registry service for storing, managing, and deploying Docker container images.

## Prerequisites
Before we begin, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

1. An AWS account
2. Docker installed on WSL 2 - [Guide](https://krishnakalesh.github.io/pinchofcode/post/wsl2_docker_windows/)
3. An existing Dockerized project to create a docker image to upload

## Install AWS CLI on WSL 2
Refer AWS documentation - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html
The AWS CLI uses glibc, groff, and less. These are included by default in most major distributions of Linux.

```shell
sudo apt update -y && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install glibc-source groff less unzip -y
curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
unzip awscliv2.zip
aws --version
```
## Connect to AWS ECR from WSL 2
If you are freshly installing AWS CLI, it will ask for configuring AWS
Use below command for configuration
```shell
aws configure
```
Provide AWS Access Key ID, AWS Secret Key and region details when prompted

## Push image to AWS ECR from WSL 2
Create a repository in AWS ECR and when you click 'View Push Commands', you will 
get commands that need to be used to push to ECR.

```shell
aws ecr get-login-password --region ap-south-1 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin AWSACCTNUM.dkr.ecr.REGION.amazonaws.com
docker build -t xyz .
docker tag xyz:latest AWSACCTNUM.dkr.ecr.REGION.amazonaws.com/xyz:latest
docker push AWSACCTNUM.dkr.ecr.REGION.amazonaws.com/xyz:latest
```

## Verify in AWS Console

Once image has been pushed, we can go to AWS ECR console and verify.

This process enables you to seamlessly deploy containerized applications on AWS infrastructure using Docker containers managed by ECR.
